            I'm a Software Engineer from Moscow. I learned programming years ago, when I was a kid.
            And for the last 5 years I work as a full-stack web developer.
            I'm rather agnostic when it comes to programming languages, frameworks and tools, however I've got my own favorites
            and those are PHP 7, Python 3, GO and Elixir. I love working with modern frameworks like Laravel, Django and Phoenix.
